    <h2>Audio Input</h2>
    <p>
      In order to receive audio data, sound from a computer is plugged into an
      audio connector breakout, allowing us to actually receive and use the
      analog voltages that correspond to the sound waves to be outputted. The
      voltage from one end of the audio connector (corresponding to either left
      or right in stereo audio) was used as the input to one of the ADC channels
      on the RP2040, allowing us to read in the analog voltages of the sound as
      it is played from a device. Becuase the ADC channel on the RP2040 requires
      a voltage between 0V and 3.3V, a voltage divider is used to hold the ADC
      pin at a mid-rail bias, and a series capacitor is placed in between the
      ADC conncection and the audio jack output in order to capture the correct
      analog voltage behavior centered around a 1.65V bias. This voltage divider
      and series capacitor also acts as a high pass filter with a break
      frequency at around 160 Hz. Though we can still hear in a frequency range
      below 160 Hz, it is ultimately a very quiet range for us to hear, and
      concluded that it is not important to keep those frequencies at unity
      gain.

    <p>
      The design for the audio input network was inspired by the "<a

        target="_blank">Audio Spatializer</a>" project by Bianca Tseng, Crystal
      Shi, and Rosie Wildermuth in the Fall 2022 section of ECE 4760. Their
      implementation included a low pass filter at around 5kHz to eliminate
      aliasing effects, but we chose not to implement this filter after finding
      that the there were no significnat audible artifacts when removing that
      low pass filter.
    </p>
    <h2>Audio Output</h2>
    <p>
      The final sound output after audio processing is accomplished using a
      12-bit digital to analog converter that communicates with the RP2040 using
      SPI. The DAC has the ability to produce audio for two separate audio
      channels, but because we are only using single-ended audio, only one of
      these channels is used. An additional audio jack connects to the DAC
      output in order to capture the analog voltages and transfer them into an
      audio cable connected to a speaker. Both ends of the audio connector are
      attached to the same DAC output channel in order to ensure mono audio.
